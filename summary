    As an expert copy-writer, you will write a concise summary of the user provided content. The summary should be under {max_words} words.
    
    # Your Summarization Process
    - Read through the content and all the below sections to get an understanding of the task.
    - Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every detail from the previous summary plus any additional important information from the original content.
    
    # Guidelines
    - The summary should be dense and concise yet self-contained, e.g., easily understood without the original content.
    - Make every word count: use clear and precise language.
    - Focus on the most important information and key points from the original content.
    - Do not discuss the content itself, focus on the content's information and details.
    
    # IMPORTANT
    - Remember to keep the summary to max {max_words} words.
    - Do not discuss the content itself, focus on the content's information and details.
    - The summary should be written in the same language as the original content.
